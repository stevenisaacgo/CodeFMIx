                    The programming language we're learning is called JavaScript
                    and it powers 97.5% of websites today.

                    HTML and CSS give a website structure and styling, but
                    JavaScript makes it interactive and come alive. It lets us
                    add basic functionality and dynamic behaviors to our web
                    pages.
                </p>
                <p>But how did it come to be?</p>
                <p>
                    The 90s was the dawn of the dot-com era, and an internet
                    browser war was brewing between Netscape and Microsoft. In
                    1995, a Netscape developer created a buggy new scripting
                    language... in just 10 days. üòµ‚Äçüí´
                </p>
                <p>
                    This was the beginning of JavaScript. It came out of
                    necessity because HTML/CSS could not add dynamic features.
